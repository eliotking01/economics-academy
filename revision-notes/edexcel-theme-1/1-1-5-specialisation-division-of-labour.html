              <h3>Definitions and Origins</h3>
              <p>
                <span class="key-definition">Specialisation:</span>Occurs when
                individuals, firms, regions, or countries concentrate on
                producing a limited range of goods or services.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="key-definition">Division of Labour:</span>A form of
                specialisation where the production process is split into
                separate tasks, with each worker assigned a specific, repetitive
                task.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Adam Smith</strong> used the example of a pin factory to
                demonstrate that dividing labour into specialised tasks
                drastically increases productivity (output per worker).
              </p>

              <p>
                He documented that 10 specialised workers could produce
                48,000 pins daily (4,800 per worker) versus 20 pins by a single
                unspecialised worker – a
                <strong>24,000% productivity increase</strong>.

              <h3>Levels of Specialisation</h3>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Individual Level:</strong> Workers specialise in a specific task or profession. e.g a surgeon specialising in
                  cardiac surgery.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Firm Level:</strong> A company focuses on producing a particular product. e.g. a Tesla focusing on
                  electric vehicles
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Regional Level:</strong> A geographic area specialises in an industry e.g. Silicon Valley's focus on
                  technology and innovation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>National Level:</strong> Countries specialise in producing goods/services where they have a comparative advantage e.g. Saudi Arabia specialising in
                  oil production.
                </li>

                          <li>
                            <strong>Increased Productivity:</strong> Workers become quicker and more skilled at their specific task.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Lower Average Costs (Cost per Unit):</strong> Lower costs can be passed to consumers or retained as profit.

                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Increased International Trade:</strong> Countries can export their specialisation and import others, increasing global output and variety.
                          </li>
                        </ul>

                            <strong>Worker Boredom & Demotivation:</strong> Repetitive tasks can lower morale, potentially reducing quality and increasing absenteeism.

                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>High Worker Turnover:</strong> Monotonous jobs lead to staff leaving, increasing recruitment/training costs.

                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Structural Unemployment:</strong> If an industry declines, workers' highly specific skills may not be transferable.

                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Over-dependence:</strong> Regions/countries become vulnerable to demand shocks for their specialist product or supply shocks for needed imports.


                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Loss of Variety:</strong> Standardised, mass-produced goods may lack customisation.

                          </li>
                        </ul>

              <h3>The Functions of Money</h3>
              <p>
                Money solves the problems of a barter economy (which requires a <strong>double coincidence of wants</strong>) by acting as:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Medium of Exchange:</strong> Accepted as payment for goods/services, facilitating trade.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Unit of Account:</strong> Provides a common measure of value, allowing comparison of prices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Store of Value:</strong> Retains purchasing power over time, enabling saving.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Standard of Deferred Payment:</strong> Used to settle debts in the future.
                </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Link concepts:</strong> Specialisation increases productivity, which lowers costs. This is a key driver of trade and economic growth.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Application:</strong> Use Adam Smith’s pin factory as a classic example. Be prepared to identify the opportunity cost of specialisation (e.g., loss of self-sufficiency, worker flexibility).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Evaluation:</strong> Weigh the significant efficiency gains against the potential human and economic risks (e.g., worker welfare, structural unemployment). The benefits depend on the context.

                  </li>
