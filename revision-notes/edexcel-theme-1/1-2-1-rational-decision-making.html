              <h3>The Assumption of Rationality</h3>
              <p>
                In classical economic theory,
                <strong>economic agents</strong> (consumers, producers, workers,
                governments) are assumed to make
                <strong>rational decisions</strong>. Rationality means making
                choices that <strong>maximise self-interest</strong> based on a
                logical calculation of the expected net benefits of each
                available option. The agent will choose the option with the
                <strong>highest net benefit</strong>.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>How Different Agents Are Assumed to Act Rationally</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Consumers</strong> aim to maximise their
                <strong>utility</strong> (satisfaction or happiness from
                consuming goods and services).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Producers/Firms</strong> aim to maximise
                <strong>profit</strong> (total revenue minus total costs).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Workers</strong> aim to maximise their
                <strong>net welfare from employment</strong>, balancing wages,
                benefits, and working conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Governments</strong> aim to maximise
                <strong>social welfare</strong> or the public interest (e.g.,
                improving living standards).
              </p>

              <h3>Limitations of the Rationality Assumption</h3>
              <p>
                The assumption of pure rationality is often
                <strong>flawed</strong> in reality. Human behaviour is
                influenced by other factors leading to seemingly
                <strong>irrational choices</strong>.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Key Limitations for Consumers:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span class="key-definition">Bounded Rationality:</span>
                  Decisions are made with limited information, time, and
                  cognitive ability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="key-definition">Rule of Thumb/Habit:</span>
                  Relying on simple rules or past choices instead of a full
                  calculation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="key-definition">Altruism & Fairness:</span>
                  Acting against pure self-interest for moral or social reasons.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="key-definition">Emotional Influence:</span>
                  Choices swayed by marketing, impulse, or brand loyalty.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>Impact:</strong> These limitations mean real-world
                markets may not operate as efficiently as simple models predict,
                which is a source of <strong>market failure</strong>.

              <h3>Key Exam Tips & Application</h3>
              <div class="exam-tip">
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Core Definition:</strong> A
                    <strong>rational economic decision</strong> is one that
                    maximises the agent's stated objective (utility, profit,
                    etc.).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Application:</strong> Use the framework for each
                    agent. For example, a rational firm will produce up to the
                    point where marginal cost equals marginal revenue.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Evaluation:</strong> This is key for analysis. While
                    rationality is a necessary simplifying assumption for
                    building models (like demand curves), evidence from
                    <strong>behavioural economics</strong> shows systematic
                    irrationality. This challenges the predictions of
                    traditional theory.
