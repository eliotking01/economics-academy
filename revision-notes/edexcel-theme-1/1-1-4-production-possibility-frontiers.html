              <strong>Specification Coverage:</strong> Edexcel unit 1.1.4 -
              Production Possibility Frontiers. Students must learn the use of
              production possibility frontiers; the distinction between
              movements along and shifts in production possibility curves; and
              the distinction between capital and consumer goods.

                <span class="key-definition"
                  >Production Possibility Frontier:</span
                >A curve that shows the
                <strong>maximum potential output</strong> combinations of two
                goods or services an economy can achieve when all its resources
                are <strong>fully and efficiently</strong> employed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The two goods on the axes are often
                <strong>capital goods</strong> (e.g., machinery, tools - used
                for future production) and
                <strong>consumer goods</strong> (e.g., phones, food - for
                immediate consumption).

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Points on the curve (A, B, C, D) represent
                  <strong>productively efficient</strong> output combinations.
                  All resources are fully and efficiently used.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Points inside the curve (e.g., E) represent
                  <strong>inefficiency</strong> and unemployed resources. The
                  economy could produce more of both goods.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Points outside the curve (e.g., F) are
                  <strong>currently unattainable</strong> with the existing
                  resources and technology.

              <h4>Opportunity Cost and the PPF</h4>
              <p>
                The PPF visually demonstrates <strong>opportunity cost.</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>The curve is <strong>bowed outward</strong> (concave to the origin) because not all resources are perfectly adaptable between different uses. This illustrates the concept of <strong>increasing opportunity cost.</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Marginal Analysis:</strong> A movement <strong>along</strong> the curve (e.g., from C to D) shows the opportunity cost of producing more of one good. To produce more consumer goods, the economy must sacrifice producing some capital goods.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <h3>Shifts in the PPF: Economic Growth & Decline</h3>
              <p>A movement <strong>along</strong> the curve is caused by reallocating existing resources. A <strong>shift</strong> of the entire curve is caused by a change in the economy's <strong>productive potential.</strong></p>

                <li>War or conflict.</li>  
                <li>Widespread long-term unemployment that causes skills to deteriorate ('scarring').</li>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Draw and label</strong> a PPF diagram accurately, including shifts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Explain</strong> what points on, inside, and outside the curve represent.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Calculate</strong> the opportunity cost of moving between two points on the curve.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Analyse</strong> the causes and consequences of outward and inward shifts in the PPF.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Evaluate</strong> the trade-off between capital and consumer goods. An economy that chooses a point with more capital goods may grow faster in the future, shifting its PPF outwards more than an economy that prioritises immediate consumer goods.
