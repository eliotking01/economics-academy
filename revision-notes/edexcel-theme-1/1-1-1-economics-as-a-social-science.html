              Economics as a social science. Students must learn the process of
              developing models in economics, including the need to make
              assumptions; the role of the ceteris paribus assumption in
              building models; and the inability in economics to make scientific
              experiments.

              <h3>The Nature of Economics as a Social Science</h3>
              <p>
                Economics is a <strong>social science.</strong> It uses
                scientific methods to study human behaviour and societies,
                focusing on the production, distribution, and consumption of
                goods and services. It deals with complex human interactions,
                which are influenced by countless variables, making it distinct
                from natural sciences like physics or chemistry.
              </p>

              <h3>The Purpose of Economic Models</h3>
              <p>Due to this complexity, economists use models.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A model is a
                  <strong>simplified representation of economic reality</strong>
                  used to understand, explain, and predict economic behaviour.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Models require <strong>assumptions</strong> (generalisations
                  about behaviour) to make complex situations manageable.
                </li>
                <p>
                  <span class="content-example">Example:</span>The Circular Flow
                  of Income model simplifies the entire economy into a few key
                  agents (households, firms, government) and their interactions.
                </p>
              </ul>
              <div class="evaluation-point">
                <p>
                  The usefulness of a model depends on its assumptions.
                  Different economists may make different assumptions, leading
                  to different interpretations of the same data.

              <h3>The Role of Ceteris Paribus</h3>
              <p>
                To isolate the relationship between two key variables,
                economists use the principle of <strong
                  >ceteris paribus.</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="key-definition">Ceteris paribus:</span>A Latin
                phrase meaning ‘all other things being equal’ or ‘all other
                factors held constant’.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Purpose</strong>: It allows economists to analyse
                  a causal relationship between two variables without the
                  distortion of other changing factors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Example</strong>: The law of demand states
                  that ceteris paribus, as the price of a good falls, the
                  quantity demanded will increase. This holds true only if we
                  assume factors like consumer income, tastes, and the price of
                  substitute goods remain unchanged.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Limitation</strong>: In the real world, ‘other things’
                  are rarely constant, which is a key limitation of economic
                  models.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </section>

              <h3>The Inability to Conduct Controlled Experiments</h3>
              <p>
                Unlike natural sciences, economics cannot conduct
                laboratory-controlled experiments.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reason</strong>: It is impossible to isolate and
                  control all variables affecting human economic behaviour in a
                  real-world economy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Method</strong>: Instead, economists use the social
                  scientific method. This involves:

                  <ol>
                    <li>Developing a hypothesis.</li>
                    <li>
                      Conducting empirical research (gathering data through
                      observation, surveys, and historical records).
                    </li>
                    <li>Analysing the data (often using ceteris paribus).</li>
                    <li>Drawing conclusions.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Consequence</strong>: Results can vary over time and
                  between different cultures, meaning economic theories are
                  often open to debate and interpretation. Economists build
                  models based on hypotheses that have been repeatedly tested
                  through empirical research.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </section>

                    You must be able to <strong>define</strong> and
                    <strong>apply</strong> the term <strong
                      >cetertis paribus</strong
                    >
                    to any economic model (e.g., demand, supply).

                  <li>
                    Be prepared to <strong>evaluate</strong> the use of models,
                    highlighting their simplifications and reliance on
                    assumptions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Understand the core difference between economics (a social
                    science) and the natural sciences, focusing on the inability
                    to run true experiments.
